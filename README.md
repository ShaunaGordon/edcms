EdCMS
=====

A Laravel based extensible CMS.

# The Problem

This project was born out of frustration with the abysmal lack of CMS systems that are extensible, lightweight, and friendly to both developers and end-users. Right now, one has to pick between a developer-friendly, but not-really-great-for-end-users CMS, or a great-for-end-users, but developer-hostile CMS.

# Goals

- Friendly, easy to use user interface
- Developer-friendly
- Flexible storage
- Highly extensible
- Markdown editor by default
- CMS focuses on content, not design
  - Design is relegated to source code; none of this "templates in the CMS" and other mixing of using the CMS and source to manage templates/design crap
- Websites first, with blog add-on, not blog-first with websites tacked on
- Laravel based (will be 4.3 based at least; TODO - come up with plan for keeping up with Laravel releases)
